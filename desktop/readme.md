# Login Form <img height="30px" src="../mobile/assets/img/google.png">

This is an application of a login site, where I was inspired by the google registration site, and I even used a mention of the website of the own...

This is the second version of this login site, entirely developed by me, with CSS (in main, using flexbox), HTML, probably when I can develop a little more about JS API's, requests, I'll implement it here! In the meantime, I hope you enjoy my application ;)!

I made a website to Mobile version and a website to desktop version. Responsive metrics are still being measured, soon I will add more versions that will improve even more the responsiveness of the page!
Thanks, made by Joao!
