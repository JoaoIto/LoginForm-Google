# Login Form <img height="30px" src="./assets/img/google.png">

This is an application of a login site, where I was inspired by the google registration site, and I even used a mention of the website of the own...

This is the second version of this login site, entirely developed by me, with CSS (in main, using flexbox), HTML, probably when I can develop a little more about JS API's, requests, I'll implement it here! In the meantime, I hope you enjoy my application ;)!
